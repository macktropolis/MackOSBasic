Let's build a business card for the *terminal*! Because, who doesnâ€™t love faffin' around in the terminal? ðŸ˜… 

The concept isnâ€™t new. I came across the trend on [Chris Bonger's Daily Dev Tips](https://daily-dev-tips.com/posts/creating-a-business-card-for-the-terminal/), but the original concept goes back to [bitandbang](https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang). However, the idea is so cool that itâ€™s worth sharing again.

Today, weâ€™re going to take that idea and make it our own.

## What Are We Doing?  

Weâ€™re creating our very own **NPM business card** â€” a little command-line snippet thatâ€™s all about *you*. Letâ€™s get started!

Here's what the business card will look like:

## Step 1: Fork & Clone the Magic ðŸª„

First things first, head over to the [@bitandbang](https://github.com/bnb/bitandbang) repo and fork it. This is the base weâ€™re working with, so no need to reinvent the wheel.

Once youâ€™ve forked it:

1. Clone your fork to your local machine.
2. Crack it open in your favorite code editor.


## Step 2: Make It *Yours*

The magic happens in the `build.js` file. This is where youâ€™ll customize the details to make the card all about you.  

Hereâ€™s what to do:

- Replace all the placeholder info (like name, socials, etc.) with your own details.  
- Add or remove lines or elements to share your relevent information.

Once youâ€™re done, test it out locally:  

```
npm run dev
```

This will show you a preview of your custom card right in your terminal. How cool is that?

## Step 3: Publish Your Card ðŸš€

Happy with how it looks? Awesome! Time to share it with the world via NPM.  

### Update Your Package Info

Before publishing, open up the `package.json` file and tweak these fields:  

- **name**: Pick something uniqueâ€”this will be your command.  
- **version**: Start with `1.0.0`.  
- **description**: A short blurb about your card.  
- **bin**: Update this with your chosen command.  
- **repo**: Add your repo URL.  
- **homepage**: Your site or project page.  
- **author**: Thatâ€™s you!

### Publish It!

Run this command to push it to the NPM registry:  

```
npm publish
```

## Step 4: Show It Off ðŸŽ‰
Now comes the fun part. 

Open a fresh terminal and run your new card command. In my case, it looks like this:  

```
npx macktropolis
```

**Boom!** Your super cool terminal business card is live and ready to impress. Share it with your friends, colleagues, or anyone who loves tech-y awesomeness.  

So, what are you waiting for? Go fork, customize, and show off your creativity! ðŸŒŸ
